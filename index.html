          <h2>A little about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>Currently located in Nashville, Tennessee, I am a peer at Nashville Software School in Cohort 25. I graduated from the University of Tennessee in 2012 with a degree in American Studies. However, my journey to web development started close to three years ago, when I was in my role at ServiceSource as an Insides Sales Representative. There I gained valuable exposure to Javascript developers and SalesForce.com programmers. Their work was always some of the most interesting that came across my desk. I finally asked myself, “Is this the type of work I want for myself?” This led to my first Google search of <span id="search">what does it take to be a web developer?</span> </p>

          <div class="half-width">
            <p>Most people who are curious about programming quickly find the same underlying theme: if you enjoy problem solving, this is the career path for you. I never thought of myself as someone who loves puzzles and problem solving, but I soon found my stride in my first course by Skillscrush in Web Development. It’s where I learned that problem solving doesn’t always mean having an answer, it’s more about the willingness to try and find a solution; to not be afraid of failing. It’s about knowing how to fail better each time. </p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized Javascript</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writting Javascript that is easy to read and build on. I focus on constantly improving so that files are fast and easy to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
